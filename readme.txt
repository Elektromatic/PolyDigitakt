C  This pd patch creates polyphonic sounds on the monophonic Elektron 
C  Digitakt synthesizer.
C
C  There are eight monophonic tracks on the Digitakt. All eight tracks can 
C  sound at once. However, each of the tracks is monophonic.
C  
C  This patch assigns each keyboard key pressed to one of the eight monophonic
C  tracks. The eight tracks on the Digitakt are all assigned to the same sample.
